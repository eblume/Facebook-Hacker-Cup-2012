About ``fbhc``
--------------

This project contains a python package called ``fbhc``, which contains the
bulk of the code that runs for my submissions to the hacker cup. Outside of
``fbhc``, in the main project directory (alongside this file) are a set of
scripts designed to read challenge input files and produce the official output
files.

This project does NOT use any automatic package deployment and testing suite
like setuptools, because it is not intended to be deployed on any machine but
rather to simply be run from this folder.

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~
* `Python 3.0 or higher <http://python.org/download/>`_

Testing
~~~~~~~

Coming soon. Normally I use setup.py to run ``nosetests`` with ``coverage``, but
that won't work here. There will probably be a very simple bash script that runs
nose and coverage together.

Contributing
------------

For most of my projects I accept (and even beg for) contributions in the form of
emails, patches and push-requests on github, documentation and typo fixes, and
whatever you may like. In this particular project's case, though, because the
software is being used for a public challenge, I will abstain from asking for
such help.

That being said, I couldn't find anything in the TOS that prevented others from
giving you help. So... feel free if you like! Also feel free to fork my code,
although I personally would want to make sure my submissions were unique. That's
your call.
